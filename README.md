## Objectives of the Application

Objectives: The primary objectives of MedoPad can be outlined as follows:
1. Disease Detection:
• Objective: Enable accurate and reliable detection of seven major diseases
COVID-19, Brain Tumors, Breast Cancer, Alzheimer’s Disease, Diabetes,
Pneumonia, and Heart Diseases—utilizing a combination of custom-made
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG-16, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.

2. Accessibility:
• Objective: Democratize healthcare by providing individuals, irrespective of
their geographic location or proximity to medical facilities, with immediate
and remote access to disease detection services. This aligns with the broader
goal of enhancing healthcare accessibility for diverse populations.

3. User-Friendly Interface:
• Objective: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface to facilitate
seamless interaction. The interface should cater to individuals with varying levels of technological proficiency, ensuring ease of understanding and
navigation.

4. Future Enhancements:
• Objective: Continuously evolve and enhance the application by incorporating future improvements. This may include data enrichment to enhance
model accuracy, the introduction of new disease detection capabilities based
on X-ray scans or numerical inputs, and the integration of features providing
personalized health guidance.

5. Record-Keeping:
• Objective: Implement a comprehensive record-keeping system within the
application. This ensures accurate and secure maintenance of disease detection results, contributing to a holistic approach to personalized healthcare.

In summary, MedoPad operates in the context of advancing healthcare through
the integration of AI-driven diagnostics. Its objectives center around accurate
disease detection, enhanced accessibility, user-friendly interactions, continuous
improvement, robust record-keeping, and user education. These aspects collectively contribute to the application’s mission of revolutionizing healthcare by
merging the power of AI with compassionate and personalized medical solutions.
